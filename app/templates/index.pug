            h3 Problem
            p While I worked as a design intern at #[a(href="#") Shopify] I came across with problem that we had more Slack channels than employees but a lot of them were without any members (or simply just 2) or the discussion was already dead/obsolete.
            p It was hard to navigate through them and that I have accidentally joined some dead channel was more than common. This app will eliminate it and clean your Slack.
